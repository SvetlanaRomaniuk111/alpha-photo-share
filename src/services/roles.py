class RoleAccessService:
    """
    A class that checks if a user has the required role to access a resource.

    This class is used as a dependency in FastAPI routes to enforce role-based access control.
    It checks whether the user has one of the allowed roles and raises a `HTTPException` with
    a 403 Forbidden status if the user does not have the required role.

    Attributes:
        allowed_roles (list[Role]): A list of roles that are allowed to access the resource.

    Args:
        allowed_roles (list[Role]): A list of roles that are permitted to access the route or resource.

    Methods:
        __call__(request: Request, user: User):
            Checks if the user's role is in the list of allowed roles and raises an exception if not.
